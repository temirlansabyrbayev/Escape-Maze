# Escape-Maze
The program in Java can find the way to escape the maze!
The program uses a recursive approach to check whether you can escape from the maze: If you are able to reach to the exit (the 2nd block of the 1st row), return true. Recursively check whether you can escape from one of the empty neighboring locations without visiting the current location.
